Small and simple parser of debsecan output - all it does is counting number of
security issues per package. CVE information is not preserved as this utility
was only meant to give a quick (and accurate) outlook on which installed
packages have most security issues.

Sample output:
$ ./debsecan_abbrev
 14 libc6
 16 libavutil52
 16 libavfilter3
 16 libavdevice53
 16 libav-tools
 16 libavresample1
 16 libswscale2
 16 libavcodec54
 16 libavformat54
 20 libavutil51
 20 libavfilter2
 20 libavcodec53
 20 libavformat53
 20 ffmpeg
